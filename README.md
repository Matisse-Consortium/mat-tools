# MATISSE python tools

## You are on the MATISSE python tools distribution page.

The MATISSE python tools are an addition to the standard data reduction software that is distributed separately by ESO. These scripts were developped for the MATISSE commissionning and may be of some use for general users to reduce and visualize data from [MATISSE](http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/matisse.html). However, please note that they should be used at your own risks!

A quick description of how to reduce and visualize MATISSE data with these scripts together with the MATISSE DRS is given [here](Using the pipeline), and simple installation instructions are given [there](Installation).

The development status of the pipeline (including the ESO version of the code) is provided [there](Known bugs and development plan)
