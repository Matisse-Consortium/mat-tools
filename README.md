# [MATISSE python tools](https://gitlab.oca.eu/MATISSE/tools/wikis/home)

## You are on the MATISSE python tools distribution page.

The MATISSE python tools are an addition to the [standard data reduction software](http://www.eso.org/sci/software/pipelines/matisse/matisse-pipe-recipes.html) that is distributed separately by ESO. These scripts were developped for the MATISSE commissionning and may be of some use for general users to reduce and visualize data from [MATISSE](http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/matisse.html). However, please note that they should be used at your own risks!

A quick description of how to reduce and visualize [MATISSE data](https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1808/) with these scripts together with the MATISSE DRS is given [here](https://gitlab.oca.eu/MATISSE/tools/wikis/Using%20the%20pipeline), and simple installation instructions are given [there](https://gitlab.oca.eu/MATISSE/tools/wikis/Installation).

The development status of the pipeline (including the ESO version of the code) is provided [there](https://gitlab.oca.eu/MATISSE/tools/wikis/Known%20bugs%20and%20development%20plan)
